# winter python hackathon
Animating christmas tree lights

to get started:

pip install -r requirements.txt

and look inside animations folder for example code
This is the only area that should probably need working on, but feel free to explore the rest of the codebase

demo_cycle will be used to run through the various animations inside the animations folder
